# Revenue_Development_Restaurant_Industry
Restaurant Industry is one of the biggest revenue generating industries of the world. Revenue from the restaurant industry was estimated at  USD 799 Billions with 4.3% rise than the previous year which shows that restaurant trend has no near end. But, still we see that not all the restaurants shine in the market. There are a lot of restaurants which closes within an year of their opening. What do you think is the major reason behind the failure of any restaurant? Yes, it's the poor analytics ! You can save your restaurant just by the good analysis which can help you in giving insights of the market competition and, analysis of your customers' reviews, which you can use to make development in your services and ultimately increase your restaurant's revenue.
